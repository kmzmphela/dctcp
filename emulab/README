Performance Isolation test for vEmulab and Mininet

Emulab instructions:

1. Create a new emulab instance based on emulab-config.ns using a FreeBSD image.
(Note we used a FreeBSD node because we wanted to compare against the original
virtual Emulab implementation and paper which used FreeBSD.)
2. Install iperf into the FreeBSD image.
3. Run emulab-test.sh

Mininet instructions:

1. Install Mininet-HiFi onto your test system (we used a 2.4 GHz Core2 laptop)
2. Run emulab-test.py
3. It should produce results with (cfs) and without (none) CPU and bandwidth isolation.

Plotting results:

The results can be plotted using emulab-plot.py

Sample results:

Our sample results are included in the good/ directory.
